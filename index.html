The entire game was made in 4 days with 2 of us doing the main programming and content, as well as some art assets done by a friend of ours. I primarily wrote the story and dialogue system as well as UI and menu work to make things run smoothly. I am most proud of this game because I feel like we managed to accomplish a lot in 96 hours, especially story-wise. <p>Out of 9,590 entries, we received 912th in Narrative which I believe is a large accomplishment. I am planning on adding some sound and cinematic additions to the game to complete the vision we had for it.</p></h4>

All assets including 2D art, sound effects, music, story-writing and programming were all completed within the 48 hours by me. I am very proud of what I managed to make in only 48 hours and hope to keep competing in more jams to come!</h4>

I was responsible for a lot of sound design and music, as well as some UI and menus and the tutorial. I am particularly proud of this project as it encouraged me to learn new skills such as adding a grading system and both writing and implementing the endings. Overall, I believe this project is one of my most proudest achievements and we were able to achieve 3rd place in this competition!</h4>

I participated in a group of 2 and I was responsible for most of the art assets, including the 3D map which was made in Blender. One of my most interesting game jam submissions since it is a strategy game which is something I have minimal experience in.</h4>

It is also my proudest game jam I have participated in because I felt like the game was fully complete and the art I had done was some of my best work. 'Feel The Fire' is a racing game where your goal is to race the clock and get to the finish line before time runs out. There are a few interesting personalities that can be met throughout the game such as Colonel Red as depicted on the left and Clotina, a rookie who the player controls to try and impress her mentor and win the championship.</h4>

This was a group project with 5 members including myself. I took on a lot more responsibility in this project as I really felt I wanted to showcase what I could do as a developer. My tasks were a variety of different things that needed to get done before the deadline; I was working on UI and menus, sound effects, minimal art, a lot more programming and leading the team to the best of my ability. This game was also showcased at 'LevelUp' in Toronto with the other colleges and universities.</h4>
