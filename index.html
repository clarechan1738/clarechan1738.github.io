This was a group project with 5 members including myself. I took on a lot more responsibility in this project as I really felt I wanted to showcase what I could do as a developer. My tasks were a variety of different things that needed to get done before the deadline; I was working on UI and menus, sound effects, minimal art, a lot more programming and leading the team to the best of my ability. This game was also showcased at 'LevelUp' in Toronto with the other colleges and universities.</h4>

"Velocity Vortex" was created by a group of 3 and I primarily took on the art and UI tasks for menus and buttons. This game was my very first game jam and is a way to look back at how far I have come as both a programmer and a pixel artist.</h4>
