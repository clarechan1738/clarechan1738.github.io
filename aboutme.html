        <h1 class="aboutTitle">About Clare: </h1>
		<h3 class="aboutTxt">I am a 22 year old junior developer and St. Lawrence College graduate as of April 2024. I have participated in a few game jams and have been building up my skills in order to eventually create my own game studio and fully polished release one day. 
			
			<br><br>I love creating 2D games primarily since the pixel art style is my personal favourite but I am also hoping to expand on my experience by making more 3D projects in the future with more unique and difficult programming mechanics.
			<br><br>Below are some of my previous artwork and non-game related work: <br><br></h3>
